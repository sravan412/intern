Projects and Learning
Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
In this project, I have implemented a Stock Price Prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. By analyzing historical stock price data, I was able to predict the future stock prices of companies. The project helped me understand:

Data preprocessing techniques
Feature scaling and normalization
Creating sequences for LSTM input
Building and training LSTM models
Visualizing predicted vs. actual stock prices
Demo
Stock Price

Titanic Survival Classification
Another exciting project I worked on was the Titanic Survival Classification. The goal was to create a system that predicts whether a person would survive the Titanic sinking based on factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more. This project taught me:

Handling missing values in datasets
Encoding categorical variables using OneHotEncoder
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Building and training a RandomForestClassifier model
Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
Demo
